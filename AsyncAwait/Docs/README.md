## Async/Await Project description.
PS project follows Filip Eckberg.
Name: Asynchronous Programming in C#

### Non-tech changes
- Attempt to add RestSharp lib and update the project.
- This project will also contain some temporary weird commits as I'm taking git advanced course using commaind line.
   It is finally time to get away from GUI :)
- Adding ultimate guide/cheat sheet, based on Mosh Hamedani's teaching.
