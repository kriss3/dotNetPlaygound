# dotNetPlaygound Repository
Main container for exploration of number of different dotNet concepts in C#. This will be full framework project.

## Description
This repository is part of the project: Life as a Code. 
Frequent development of verity of dotNet concepts.
Focus on C# 101 including practicing new concepts but not limited to 
algorithms, data structures, core dotNet ideas.

## Change Log:
04/15 Added a new project: playing with lambda. I wanted to have a playground for extension methods with some twists to it.
I wanted to get more familiar with the latest additions to this functional feature of the language  
Minor update to the project. Lambda can now accept two connection and spit fully populated one.
Add new examples of extension to specificaly target object transformation inside code block. That exercise will help with creation of ad-hoc extension methods. 
Current work: upgrading each project to a dotnet 8 and C# 10/12 syntax 
Next step: modeling using functional C#. Code examples from ROP Railway Oriented Programming. I would like to to master creating primitive times with built in validation (let's get away from using strings)
